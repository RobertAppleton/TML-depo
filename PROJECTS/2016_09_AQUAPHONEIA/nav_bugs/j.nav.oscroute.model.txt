August 9, 2016

Issue:
Object does not actually function (& does not visually indicate it correctly either).

How to reproduce:
1) Select a function (eg: logarithmic).
2) Save patch in your cue manager.
3) Close max, reopen patch, & select your preset.

NOTES:
- same issue exists for some or all other parameters?
