Issue:
Object does not actually save membrane type (though indicates it visually correctly).

How to reproduce:
1) Select 'Circular Membrane' above the brightness knob.
2) Save patch in your cue manager.
3) Close max, reopen patch, & select your preset.
4) Run signal through patch, listen to result.
5) Then switch to 'Circular Membrane' to observe difference.

NOTES:
- same issue exists for some or all other parameters?
------------------


EM:
- seems to be something to do with the @priority setting, and order in which parameters are set on preset recall. Adding a [pipe 1000] after [j.parameter resonator] in the model seems to help, but this also seems like a less-than-ideal solution - better to find something thatâ€™s not so timing-dependent. Also need to check other params for this behaviour.

Noticed that the module is missing auto-naming arguments (both the model and the bpatcher containing the view inside the module must have an argument of #1 in order for the module to instantiate correctly when loaded as a patcher)
