Issue:
Object does not actually save membrane type (though indicates it visually correctly).

How to reproduce:
1) Select 'Circular Membrane' above the brightness knob.
2) Save patch in your cue manager.
3) Close max, reopen patch, & select your preset.
4) Run signal through patch, listen to result.
5) Then switch to 'Circular Membrane' to observe difference.
